# Intermediate_Python
This project was done within the course "Intermediate Python" from DATACAMP.
The project is a dice game. 
Game rules:		You can throw a dice 100 times. 
            	You start from step 0. 
            	If it's 1 or 2 => you go a step backwards (-1) 
            	If it's 3,4 or 5 => you go a step forward(+1) 
            	If it's 6=> you will go forward x steps, where x is the number from the dice(1 => 1 step, 2=> 2 steps,...). 
            	You can't get lower than step 0. There is a small probability(0.1%) that you tripp and fall, in that case, you will start all over again from step 0.
What is the chance that you reach 60 steps in 100 attempts to throw the dice?
